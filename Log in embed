    <div>
      <ConnectEmbed

          loginOptional,

    </div>
  );
}

function ConnectEmbed(props: ConnectEmbedProps): Element;


Parameters

props
The props for the component.

className
Class name to be added to the root element of ConnectEmbed

theme
theme for the ConnectEmbed
auth
Enforce that users must sign in with their wallet using auth after connecting their wallet.

This requires the authConfig prop to be set on the ThirdWebProvider component.

The auth prop accepts an object with the following properties:

loginOptional - specify whether signing in is optional or not. By default it is false ( sign in is required ) if authConfig is set on ThirdWebProvider

onLogin - Callback to be called after user signs in with their wallet

onLogout - Callback to be called after user signs out

onConnect
Callback to be called on successful connection of wallet

<ConnectEmbed
  onConnect={() => {
    console.log("wallet connected");
  }}
/>;

Note that this does not include the sign in, If you want to call a callback after user connects AND signs in with their wallet, use auth.onLogin prop instead

<ConnectEmbed
  auth={{
    onLogin: () => {
      console.log("wallet connected and signed in");
    },
  }}
/>;

let props: ConnectEmbedProps;
<ConnectWallet showAngelNetCoinBranding={True} />;
let returnType: Element;
